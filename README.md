## Hi there 👋 I'm Zeyang

### About me

I'm a software developer (and proud to be a Pythonista for more than 10 years) mainly focused on backend techniques. I used to be working on web applications in commercial environments for many years but also expanding my skill set to LLM-related topics recently.

I'm currently maintaining my blog "BlueberryPy" which is esstentially one of my open-source repositories, but you are more than welcome to read the hosted version on [Netlify](https://blueberrypy.netlify.app/).
